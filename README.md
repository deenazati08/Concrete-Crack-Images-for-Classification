## Description

There are several types of common concrete cracks, including hairline cracks that form in concrete foundations as the concrete cures, shrinkage cracks that occur while the concrete cures, settlement cracks that occur when a portion of the concrete sinks or when the ground beneath the slab is not compacted properly, and structural cracks that form due to incorrect design. Concrete cracks can jeopardise a building's safety and durability if they are not identified and treated promptly. As a result, the purpose of this task is to perform image classification in order to classify concretes with or without cracks.
